"""
Direct webhook alert bot runner.

This script provides a simplified entry point that runs the webhook
alert bot directly without performing environment validation.  It is
useful for local development or situations where you are confident
that all required environment variables are already set via a ``.env``
file.  Previously this helper was intended for Replit deployments,
but it has been generalized and now reads configuration from the
standard ``.env`` file when run.
